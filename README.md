Trying to find a good data for security incidents to understand where adversaries are succeeding. Experiment to convert this datasest https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents into parsable format.

Deployed here - https://experiment-csis-significantcyberincidents.streamlit.app/

This dataset lacks the level of technical detail I'm looking for. Posting it here in case anyone wants to build on top of it.
